 * Requirements:
 * - Large, touch-friendly buttons for Addition and Subtraction

 *
 * UI Components needed:
 * - ModeButton component (large, colorful, with icon)
 * - Header with app title
 * - Footer with "Made for learning" message?
 *
 * State management:
 * - Selected mode (addition/subtraction)
 * - Optional: difficulty level (max number range)
